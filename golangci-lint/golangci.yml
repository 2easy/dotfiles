    - errcheck # Errcheck is a program for checking for unchecked errors in Go code. These unchecked errors can be critical bugs in some cases.
    - gosimple # Linter for Go source code that specializes in simplifying code.
    - govet # Vet examines Go source code and reports suspicious constructs. It is roughly the same as 'go vet' and uses its passes.
    - ineffassign # Detects when assignments to existing variables are not used.
    - staticcheck # It's a set of rules from staticcheck. It's not the same thing as the staticcheck binary. The author of staticcheck doesn't support or approve the use of staticcheck as a library inside golangci-lint.
    - unused # Checks Go code for unused constants, variables, functions and types.
    # non-default
    - asciicheck # Checks that all code identifiers does not have non-ASCII symbols in the name.
    - bodyclose # Checks whether HTTP response body is closed successfully.
    - copyloopvar # Copyloopvar is a linter detects places where loop variables are copied.
    - contextcheck # Check whether the function uses a non-inherited context.
    - dogsled # Checks assignments with too many blank identifiers (e.g. x, , , _, := f()).
    - errname # Checks that sentinel errors are prefixed with the Err and error types are suffixed with the Error.
    - gci # Gci controls Go package import order and makes it always deterministic.
    - goconst # Finds repeated strings that could be replaced by a constant.
    - gocritic # Provides diagnostics that check for bugs, performance and style issues. Extensible without recompilation through dynamic rules. Dynamic rules are written declaratively with AST patterns, filters, report message and optional suggestion.
    - godot # Check if comments end in a period.
    - gofumpt # Gofumpt checks whether code was gofumpt-ed.
    - gosec # Inspects source code for security problems.
    - lll # Reports long lines.
    - misspell # Finds commonly misspelled English words.
    - mnd # An analyzer to detect magic numbers.
    - nestif # Reports deeply nested if statements.
    - nolintlint # Reports ill-formed or insufficient nolint directives.
    - prealloc # Finds slice declarations that could potentially be pre-allocated.
